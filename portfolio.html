   <p id="About_Me"><b>ABOUT ME</b><br><br>I am a graduate of <span class="important">Electrical and Telecommunications engineering from Moi University</span> and currently work as a Senior Network Administrator at Safaricom PLC.  I am tasked with the function of providing support to network related faults/ providing solutions on how to enhance the efficiency of our current network design through automation. I am stimulated by challenging work and have a natural curiosity which drives my work ethic.</p>
     
   <p>My passion in simplifying work has been the key motivation on why I chose to enroll for the <strong>Robotics and Process Automation Programming class</strong>. My day-to-day work involves repetitive operational tasks for provisioning customers ipsec vpn tunnels and remote access ssl vpn which is a very manual and time-consuming process. Also, as part of my role, I am tasked with bulk deployment of network devices and will be keen on developing a tool that can help push these configurations at once for easy management and reduction of human errors that occur when manually running the scripts. Generally, I intend to use my automation skills to help Safaricom to achieve higher productivity, reliability, availability and increased performance for our systems.</p>
